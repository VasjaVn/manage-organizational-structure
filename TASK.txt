Problem
You are designing a web application that manages organizational structure for parent and child companies.
Each company has two properties, they are company name and estimated annual earnings.
There are two types of companies: 1- Main company, 2 - Subsidiary company.
The company can belong only to one company but can have a few child companies.


Requirements
- The application should allow a user to view/add/edit/delete any company.
- Company name and estimated earnings should be stored in database
- Show companies tree

Example:
Name | Company Estimated Earnings | Company Estimated Earnings + Child Companies(on all levels) Estimated Earnings
If you edit earnings of Company3 from 5 to 10, total earnings of Company1 should be updated automatically from 53 to 58. If you add Company8 as child of Company3, total of Company1 should be updated as well.

 -Company1 | 25K$ | 53K$
  --Company2 | 13K$ | 18K$
   ---Company3 | 5K$
  --Company4 | 10K$
-Company5 | 10K$ | 30K$
--Company6 | 15K$
--Company7 | 5K$

- Nesting level is not limited
- Companies quantity on each level is unlimited
- Single page approach should be used.
